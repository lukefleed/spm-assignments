 *
 * Memory Management Philosophy:
 * - Auxiliary buffer strategy trades 2x memory for algorithmic simplicity
 * - Alternative in-place merging:
 *   * Pros: O(1) additional memory vs O(n) auxiliary buffer
 *   * Cons: Complex rotation algorithms, poor cache locality, higher constant
 * factors
 *   * Cons: Difficult parallelization due to overlapping write dependencies
 * - Buffer ping-pong eliminates complex merge coordination between levels
 *
 * Task Granularity and Load Balancing:
 * - Static work decomposition chosen over dynamic work stealing
 * - Oversubscription factor (4x threads) provides load balancing resilience
 * - Alternative dynamic scheduling:
 *   * Pros: Perfect load balancing for irregular workloads
 *   * Cons: Task stealing overhead, cache coherency issues, complex

 * @struct MergeTask
 * @brief Task descriptor for sort and merge operations
 *
 * TASK DESIGN RATIONALE AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY:
 *
 * Raw Pointer Usage vs Smart Pointers:
 * - Raw pointers chosen for minimal task creation overhead in high-frequency
 * operations
 * - Alternative std::shared_ptr/std::unique_ptr consideration:
 *   * Cons: Reference counting overhead (atomic operations) in parallel context
 *   * Cons: Additional heap allocation for control blocks degrades cache
 * performance
 *   * Cons: Automatic lifetime management unnecessary with explicit task
 * cleanup
 * - Memory ownership remains with caller (data vector) ensuring clear semantics
 * - Explicit task deletion in worker nodes prevents memory leaks without RAII
 * overhead
 *
 * POD Structure Design:
 * - Lightweight task representation minimizes copying overhead in farm queues
 * - Cache-friendly layout: frequently accessed fields (start, end) grouped
 * together
 * - Alternative: Object-oriented task hierarchy with virtual dispatch
 *   * Cons: Virtual function call overhead per task, vtable cache misses
 *   * Cons: Larger task objects increase memory pressure in internal queues
 *
 * Lightweight POD structure designed for minimal overhead task passing.
 * Uses raw pointers to avoid std::shared_ptr allocation overhead in
 * high-frequency farm operations. Memory ownership remains with caller
 * to prevent expensive reference counting in parallel execution paths.
 *
 * Task semantics:
 * - Sort phase: [start, end) defines segment, mid unused (end == mid)
 * - Merge phase: merges [start, mid) and [mid, end) from source to dest

 * @class Emitter
 * @brief Task generator implementing work decomposition for farm patterns
 *
 * WORK DECOMPOSITION STRATEGY AND SCHEDULING ANALYSIS:
 *
 * Static vs Dynamic Task Generation:
 * - Static decomposition with offset-based iteration chosen for predictable
 * overhead
 * - Alternative dynamic work stealing:
 *   * Pros: Perfect load balancing for irregular workloads
 *   * Cons: Work stealing protocols add synchronization overhead
 *   * Cons: Cache thrashing from cross-core queue access patterns
 * Merge sort has uniform O(n log n) work distribution, static
 * sufficient
 *
 * Template Method Pattern Application:
 * - Single emitter class handles both sort and merge phases via
 * parameterization
 * - Alternative: Separate emitter classes for each phase
 *   * Cons: Code duplication, increased maintenance burden
 *   * Cons: Additional virtual dispatch overhead in phase switching
 * - Phase differentiation through constructor parameters maintains type safety
 *
 * Lock-Free Design Considerations:
 * - Offset-based iteration eliminates need for complex state synchronization
 * - Single-producer (emitter) to multiple-consumer (workers) pattern is
 * naturally lock-free
 * - Alternative: Shared work queue with locks
 *   * Cons: Lock contention becomes bottleneck at high thread counts
 *
 * Dual-purpose emitter serving both sort and merge phases through
 * constructor parameterization. Uses offset-based iteration to avoid
 * complex state management while ensuring lock-free task generation.
 * Template method pattern enables phase-specific task creation logic.

 * Two-Way vs K-Way Merge Strategy:
 * - Two-way merge chosen for optimal cache behavior and algorithmic simplicity
 * - Alternative k-way merge with priority queue:
 *   * Pros: Could reduce merge levels from logâ‚‚(n) to log_k(n)
 *   * Cons: Priority queue overhead (log k per element vs O(1) for two-way)
 *   * Cons: Poor cache locality with k memory streams, TLB pressure
 *   * Cons: Complex load balancing with variable-sized merge ranges
 *   * Analysis: Cache misses dominate for large k, two-way optimal for modern
 * architectures
 *
 * Move Semantics vs Copy Semantics:
 * - Move iterators eliminate deep-copy overhead for variable-size payloads
 * - Critical optimization for large payload sizes (metadata, embedded objects)
 * - Alternative: Copy-based merge for POD-like records
 *   * Pros: Potentially faster for small, simple record types
 *   * Cons: Payload size determined at runtime, copy overhead scales linearly
 *   * Cons: Loss of optimization opportunities for complex Record types
 *
 * Stability Preservation:
 * - std::merge maintains relative ordering of equivalent elements
 *
 * Performs out-of-place merge using move semantics to minimize
