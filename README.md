# Parallel and Distributed Systems - Assignments

This repository contains the 4 assignments for the "Parallel and Distributed Systems" course (Academic Year 2024/25) at the University of Pisa, Master's Degree in Computer Science.

## Assignments Overview

- **Assignment 1**: Softmax function optimization with vectorization techniques (plain, auto-vectorized, and AVX implementations)

- **Assignment 2**: Collatz sequence computation using different parallel scheduling algorithms (static and dynamic)

- **Assignment 3**: Parallel file compression/decompression using OpenMP and the Miniz library, implementing block-based parallelism for efficient DEFLATE compression

- **Assignment 4**: Hybrid distributed mergesort combining MPI for inter-node communication and FastFlow for intra-node parallelization

Each assignment folder contains its own detailed README with build instructions, usage examples, and implementation details.
